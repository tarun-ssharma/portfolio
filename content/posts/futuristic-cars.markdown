Can cushion separating vehicles reduce accidents?
- how to? magnetic/ rubber / 
- we want to maintain a minimum separation between vehicles no matter what 
- Why are cars made of steel:
	- absorbing and distributing crash loads -- elasticity
	- structural rigidity -- helps in movement and provides smooth motion
	- post-crash repair -- Availability of material, ease of repair
	- recyclable -- heat
	- cost for the amount required to provide strength and elasticity -- 
	- protected from corrosion by paints -- durability, stability
	- lightweight (weight for the amount required to provide strength and elasticity) -- 
	- alternative: carbon fibre
	- steel better meshes with other structural components: nuts, bolts, tyres
