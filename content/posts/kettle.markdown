Kettle:

1920s -- fire + water in a vessel
	  -- vessel made of iron initially; later of copper cause thermal conductivity of copper is more (less resistance to heat flow)
	  -- early 1900s -- whistling kettle -- steam used to indicate water has heated enough
	  		-- fluid dynamics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_whistles)
	  		-- [Amazing] Design came first, logic came after: https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/how-the-kettle-got-its-whistle
	  
1891 -- first electric ketttle: design issue:
			-- heating element in diff compartment -- takes too long to heat 

1920 -- design issue solved:
			-- placed heating element inside a metallic cylinder, which is placed directly inside the water


Current kettles:
	-- heating by resistence to current flow
	-- uses differential heat expansion of metals for the 'cut-off' feature when water reaches boiling point

What is a kettle?
Simply a device to warm any liquid.

Can I warm my liquids through something else?
Sure. A typical gas stove, electric stove, oven maybe.

Then why do I need a kettle?

https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/75664/why-use-a-kettle-to-heat-water
1. Electric kettle -- turns off when water is boiled enough
2. doesn't heat water too much unlike microwave 
3. heats it up quickly 
doesnt take much space and is portable
more efficient (power consumption) -- saving electricity and money
the heating element is in direct contact with water -- no pot to heat 


oven:
- the mug containing water is also heated -- consumer more power but keeps water hot for longer once removed
- uses up a lot of energy in-efficiently to heat up the microwave emitter -- 60-65% power efficiency
- 

stove:
- two heat transfers -- element to pot, pot to water
- heat loss if no lid used

More considerations:
- is natural gas cheaper than electricity where you live
- can buy a microwave if you have other uses -- a kettle if you mostly only boil pasta, tea or water
- most kettles have a minimum fill line -- several cups of water wasted  -- if you need only a cup of water, better to microwave
- 

Other reasons (people's perceptions/practical considerations):
- microwaved water tastes different
- you need to know the temperature settings and how the oven will behave according to the room temperature and stuff(takes longer in winter)
- stoves -- visible when water gets heated
- easier to heat larger amount of water in kettle or stove rather than using an oven cup multiple times
- electric stove -- water gets heated too fast; can spill all over or dry up if not paying attention 
- kettles -- not regularly washed -- limescale tends to deposit; changing the water flavor
- many types of tea taste better when steeped with hot but not boiling water ==> able to control temperature -- some kettles have built in
	- will need to let water cool off when using a stove
	- can learn this about the oven, how much time it takes by repeating over a period of time

Physics forces at work:
JOule's law
convection

How can we make these kettles even better?
- IoT ? 
- allowing it to heat up more types of food? -- makes it less specific  : generality vs specificity
